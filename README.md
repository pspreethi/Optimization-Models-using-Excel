# Supply Chain Optimization: Outsourcing and Near-Sourcing in the Apparel Industry

This repository contains the simulation model developed for an academic supply chain analysis as part of the IS610 course at CSULB.

The project explores two sourcing strategies for a Limited Edition Collection (LEC) in the apparel industry:
- **Scenario A:** Full outsourcing to a Ukrainian manufacturer  
- **Scenario B:** Hybrid approach combining outsourcing and near-sourcing  

We used linear regression and simulation techniques to assess demand uncertainty, cost, and risk.
